# MultiSafepay plugin Shopware 6

We’re proud to be able to launch our first beta of the Shopware 6 plugin!

This release should not be used on live/production environments, as it may contain bugs and/or limited functionality.

It does not contain our full range of features and or functionalities as Shopware 6 is also still in Early Access mode.
Our primary goal is to reach out to interested developers and work together on creating a seamless product to be launched in the first official release.

In this, there is a chance for you to be among the pioneers of Shopware 6 as part of a new e-commerce revolution, as well as an opportunity to become an active voice within the MultiSafepay community.
Let’s iron out the bugs and improve together.

## What is Shopware 6?
Shopware 6 is the sequel to Shopware 5, a popular open source ecommerce platform. For more information, make sure you check out [Shopware 6](https://www.shopware.com/en/products/shopware-6/).
